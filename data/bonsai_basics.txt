Bonsai (盆栽) is the Japanese art of growing and training miniature trees in containers, derived from the Chinese practice of penjing. The term "bonsai" literally translates to "tray planting" (bon = tray/pot, sai = planting). Unlike other container gardening, bonsai focuses on the long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees to create a miniaturized but realistic representation of nature.

Key Principles of Bonsai:
1. Miniaturization: Keeping trees small through pruning, root reduction, and restricted pot size
2. Proportion: Maintaining aesthetic balance between all parts of the tree
3. Asymmetry: Following the principle of "thirds" rather than centering
4. Perspective: Creating the illusion of a full-sized, mature tree in nature
5. Poetic Expression: Capturing the essence of natural scenery in miniature form

The practice requires extensive knowledge of plant biology, horticultural techniques, and artistic principles. Successful bonsai cultivation demands regular maintenance including watering, fertilization, pruning, wiring, and repotting.
